Hello world! This is an alternate account for all internet-related repositories that I don't wish to mix with my main account. 

Creator of DRG Modding, cyubeVR Modding & Astro Colony Modding organisations.

My current projects:
- Working with the developers of Astro Colony to bring a full asset modkit, modding API and in-game mod support
- Working with [LongerWarrior](https://github.com/LongerWarrior) to create the [UEAssetToolkitGenerator](https://github.com/LongerWarrior/UEAssetToolkitGenerator) tool, which serializes cooked UE assets into a format that can be used to generate fully reconstructed assets in-editor
- Creating the most fully-equiped user-generated modkit possible, for a number of games, namely Deep Rock Galactic & cyubeVR
- Contributing to open source UE modding tools such as [CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse)/[FModel](https://github.com/4sval/FModel), [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS), [UEAssetToolkit](https://github.com/Archengius/UEAssetToolkit)
- A comprehensive document outlining high level detail of the entire UE4/5 modding scene, aimed towards game developers to be more informed on what is possible
- Building a network of connections between UE tool developers to make collaboration much easier

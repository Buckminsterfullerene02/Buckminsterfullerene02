Hello world! This is an alternate account for all internet-related repositories that I don't wish to mix with my main account. 

My current projects:
- Working with the developers of [Astro Colony](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614550/Astro_Colony/) & [Railgrade](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/railgrade) to bring the best possible in-game mod support and modding API 
- Working with [LongerWarrior](https://github.com/LongerWarrior) to create the [UEAssetToolkitGenerator](https://github.com/LongerWarrior/UEAssetToolkitGenerator) tool, which serializes cooked UE assets into a format that can be used to generate fully reconstructed assets in-editor
- Creating the most fully-equiped user-generated modkit possible, for a number of games, namely [Deep Rock Galactic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/) & [cyubeVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/619500/cyubeVR/)
- Contributing to open source UE modding tools such as, [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) & [UEAssetToolkit](https://github.com/Archengius/UEAssetToolkit)
- Writing a [comprehensive document](https://unreal-modding-library.github.io/dev-guide/) outlining high level detail of the entire UE4/5 modding scene, aimed towards game developers to be more informed on what is possible
- Building a network of connections between UE tool developers to make collaboration much easier 

My past projects:
- Worked with the cyubeVR developer to bring full mod support
- Created comprehensive modding guides for Deep Rock Galactic & cyubeVR

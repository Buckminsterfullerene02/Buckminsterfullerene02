Hello world! This is an alternate account for all internet-related repositories that I don't wish to mix with my main account. 

My current projects:
- Taking a break from modding, but still doing little things here and there :D
- Writing a [comprehensive document](https://buckminsterfullerene02.github.io/dev-guide/) outlining high level detail of the entire UE4/5 modding scene, aimed towards game developers to be more informed on what is possible
- Building a network of connections between UE tool developers to make collaboration much easier 

My past projects:
- Worked with the [cyubeVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/619500/cyubeVR/) developer to bring native UE mod support
- Consulted with the developer of [Astro Colony](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614550/Astro_Colony/) to bring native UE mod support, including a play-in-editor modkit
- Consulted with the lead developer of [Railgrade](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/railgrade) on in-game mod support and modding API 
- Worked with the amazing [LongerWarrior](https://github.com/LongerWarrior) to create the [UEAssetToolkitGenerator](https://github.com/LongerWarrior/UEAssetToolkitGenerator) tool, which serializes cooked UE assets into a format that can be used to generate fully reconstructed assets in-editor
- Created the most fully-equiped user-generated modkit possible, mostly for [Deep Rock Galactic](https://github.com/DRG-Modding/Community-Modkit)
- Written a number of comprehensive modding guides for [Deep Rock Galactic](https://mod.io/u/buckminsterfullerene/r)
- Contributed to popular open source UE modding tools such as [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) & [UEAssetToolkit](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/UEAssetToolkit-Fixes)
